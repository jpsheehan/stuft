The road was wet at the time of the crash, leaving no skid marks.</p> \n<p>\"There has been a ball of fire, we know this from CCTV footage,\" Price said.</p> \n<p>Both officers&nbsp;went directly to the car and \"did their very best\" to get the teens&nbsp;out, but were unable to, he said.</p> \n<p>The officers, who&nbsp;were at home recuperating from smoke inhalation, were \"absolutely devastated\" by the deaths, Price said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A disaster victim identification team would identify&nbsp;the three dead teens, but police had a \"fair idea\" who they were from items in the car, which was stolen the same night as the crash.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Police were in contact with their families, he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>'NEVER SEEN SOMEONE GOING SO FAST'</strong></p> \n<p>Mark Scott was sitting at the lights on the corner of Moorhouse Ave and Montreal St when a car shot past him.</p> \n<p>\"It shook the hell out of my car, worse than a large truck going past you on an open road,\" Scott said.</p> \n<p>Two police cars in pursuit followed, as the car went through red lights.</p> \n<p>Police appeared to abandon the chase near the next set of lights, at the Moorhouse Ave and Antigua St intersection, Scott said.</p> \n<p>\"I've never seen someone going so fast down Moorhouse let alone through red lights like that.\"</p> \n<p>Blenheim Rd resident Ruth Maxwell said police seemed to be \"astonished\" by the crash.</p> \n<p>\"When I came out, the police were standing there and I don't think they realised what to do,\" Maxwell said.</p> \n<p>\"They were as astonished by what happened as anyone else.\"</p> \n<p>Maxwell was at home when she heard \"a loud whoosh\".</p> \n<p>\"We came out, and it was all alight. We just missed the crash by literally seconds,\" she said.</p> \n<p>\"You couldn't really see much except for a huge ball of fire.\"</p> \n<p>Three police cars were at the scene when the crash happened. Another 10 police cars arrived following the crash, Maxwell said.</p> \n<p><strong>CAR TYRES EXPLODE IN FIRE</strong></p> \n<p>Another resident, Rachel Cullen, said she could smell the fire from her home, across the road from the scene.</p> \n<p>She was in her bedroom when she heard police cars \"screaming out\", she said.</p> \n<p>She heard a \"huge crash\" and thought the car had gone through a shop window.</p> \n<p>When she looked outside she saw the car on fire.</p> \n<p>\"A tyre exploded because of the heat, then the second tyre went and the third tyre went. It was just blazing,\" she said.</p> \n<p>Another resident saw a tent at the scene after the incident.</p> \n<p>Price said the outcome was the last thing police wanted to see.</p> \n<p>\"We now have families who have lost their loved ones and our thoughts are with them during this difficult time. We are currently working to notify and support their next of kin, as well as supporting our staff involved.\"</p> \n<p><strong>SPIKES DEFLATE, NOT BURST,&nbsp;TYRES</strong></p> \n<p>Police Association president Chris Cahill said the \"tragic consequences\" of laying the road spikes could not have been anticipated.</p> \n<p>He said spikes caused tyres to deflate and the car to stop further down the road, rather than the tyres blowing out.</p> \n<p>\"What's clear is the pursuit had been called off several minutes beforehand and the car continued to travel at speed after that, the dangers the driver presented continued,&nbsp;and was still a risk to members of the public and themselves.</p> \n<p>\"It wasn't being caused by police officers pursuing, but clearly by those people choosing to drive at those dangerous speeds, therefore, the decision to deploy spikes on the face of it is done to try and reduce the risk by stopping that vehicle and so the risk to the members of the public is reduced, unfortunately it's had tragic consequences, but consequences that couldn't really have been foreseen.\"</p> \n<p><strong>PURSUIT&nbsp;REVIEW WEEKS AWAY</strong></p> \n<p>The number of people killed during police pursuits increased every year between 2014 and 2017.</p> \n<p>Police and the IPCA are reviewing their fleeing driver policy on a nationwide level.</p> \n<p>The findings were initially expected to be released late last year, but \"because of the complexity of the issues and the need for careful analysis\", the report is now expected to be finalised in February.</p> \n<p>Cahill said he was interested to see the outcome of the review.</p> \n<p>\"This incident highlights no one incident is the same, each incident had their own sets of circumstances. If police did nothing that vehicle was going to continue to travel at speed and could have had serious impacts for innocent members of the public.\"</p> \n<p>Human rights lawyer&nbsp;Deborah Manning said New Zealand was out of step with international practise around police pursuits.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"We should not be pursuing, or chasing, drivers for speeding. It puts people into flight mode and young people cannot make good decisions under that pressure.</p> \n<p>\"Speeding does not justify losing three young lives.\"</p> \n<p><strong>RASH OF FATAL PURSUIT CRASHES</strong></p> \n<p>In November, Alexia Chrissy-Marie Noble-Hazelwood, 18, died and three others, including her twin brother, were injured <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/108719796/driver-who-allegedly-fled-scene-of-fatal-crash-charged-with-manslaughter\" title=\"\">in a crash following a police pursuit</a>. The car went through a fence, hit a tree and then came to a stop in a building at the entrance to Christchurch East School on Gloucester St in Christchurch about 11.15pm. The 19-year-old suspected driver, Darrin Ray Stewart, allegedly fled the scene. He&nbsp;has been charged with manslaughter.</p> \n<p>On December 5, driver Dennis Tunnicliffe, 25, and his pregnant passenger Renee Percy, 35, died <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/109131273/pregnant-mum-renee-percy-killed-in-doublefatal-christchurch-crash\" title=\"\">when the car, travelling at more than twice the speed limit, smashed into a power pole at the corner of Breezes Rd and Cuthberts Rd in Aranui about 2.30am.</a> One passenger survived.</p> \n<p>Price said pursuits like the one in the early hours were extremely testing for police.</p> \n<p>\"They are fast-moving, unpredictable and high pressure situations that require quick judgements.</p> \n<p>\"Ultimately, police are here to protect our community. Our staff must strike a balance between the responsibility to protect life and the duty to enforce the law.\"</p> \n<p>A police investigation into the latest incident was under way, Price said.</p> \n<p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority would also investigate, which was standard practise, he said.</p>","images":[{"id":109914706,"position_after_paragraph":6,"datetime_iso8601":"20190114T162153+1300","datetime_display":"16:21 14/01/2019","creditline":"SUPPLIED / NZ POLICE","source_code":"the-press","source_name":"The Press","caption":"The charred remains of the fleeing car, which exploded after crashing in Christchurch, killing the three teenage boys inside.
